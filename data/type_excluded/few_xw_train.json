            "P": "Statement1: Environmentalist : it takes less energy to make molten glass from recycled glass than from raw materials. Once the recycled glass or raw materials have been turned into molten glass, making bottles from recycled glass follows the same process as making bottles from raw materials. Statement2: Obviously, soft drink bottlers who make a large percentage of their bottles from recycled glass have significant energy savings. Statement3: Therefore, by using recycled glass instead of glass made from raw materials, bottlers can lower their costs and benefit the environment at the same time."

Ants from these nests are more aggressive than those from single-queen nests.

Statement4: Since certain predator insects in brazil limit the fire-ant population there, importing such predator insects into the united states would be of overall benefit to the environment by stopping the increase of the fire-ant population in the united states."
