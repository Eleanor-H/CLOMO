Statement2: It is claimed that this practice delays public access to potentially beneficial information that, in extreme instances, could save lives. Statement3: Yet prepublication peer review is the only way to prevent erroneous and therefore potentially harmful information from reaching a public that is ill equipped to evaluate medical claims on its own. Statement4: Therefore, waiting until a medical journal has published the research findings that have passed peer review is the price that must be paid to protect the public from making decisions based on possibly substandard research."

            "O": "Premise1: An electrical substation fails when the current it handles rises above its maximum capacity.",
            "P": "Statement1: In the next decade, a large percentage of municipalities throughout the country will experience power failures if they do not modernize their electrical substations. Statement2: The vast majority of substations in the country already handle currents between 60 % and 80 % of their maximum capacity, and currents are expected to rise, perhaps by as much as a factor of 3 in the next decade, because of population increase and the increased demand from both industry and electronics in individual homes."
