Statement3: When molten rocks crystallize, they display the polarity of earth's magnetic field at that time. But the recrystallized rocks recovered at the site display normal magnetic polarity, even though earth's magnetic field was reversed at the time of the mass extinction."

A dime size amount rubbed on the infected area daily is the prescribed dosage, and applying the cream more often does not enhance the cream's healing effects. Statement3: Hence, distributing coupons giving $ 3.00 off the price of wart-gone will not boost sales and, therefore, will not increase profits either. \nPremise1: The $3. 00 coupons, if distributed, would not induce new customers, who might not have purchased the product otherwise, to try wart-gone. \nPremise2: Wart-gone can be produced in small or large batches without appreciably lowering the pre-tube production costs.\n\nPlease write the modified argument below:\n\nModified Argument:\nStatement1: Wart-gone cream is a well-known cure for reducing the spread of painful warts.
