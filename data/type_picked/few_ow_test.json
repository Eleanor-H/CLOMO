A dime size amount rubbed on the infected area daily is the prescribed dosage, and applying the cream more often does not enhance the cream's healing effects. Statement3: Hence, distributing coupons giving $ 3.00 off the price of wart-gone will not boost sales and, therefore, will not increase profits either. \nPremise1: The $3. 00 coupons, if distributed, would not induce new customers, who might not have purchased the product otherwise, to try wart-gone. \nPremise2: Wart-gone can be produced in small or large batches without appreciably lowering the pre-tube production costs.\n\nPlease write the modified argument below:\n\nModified Argument:\nStatement1: Wart-gone cream is a well-known cure for reducing the spread of painful warts.
