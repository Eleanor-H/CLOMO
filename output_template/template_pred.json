Imposing the fee at the time of salvage would reduce waste more effectively, however, because consumers tend to keep old appliances longer if they are faced with a fee for discarding them. Statement2: To cover the cost of salvage, the government is planning to charge a fee, which would be imposed when the appliance is first sold. Premise1: Increasing the cost of disposing of an appliance properly increases the incentive to dispose of it improperly. Premise2: Many nonfunctioning appliances that are currently discarded could be repaired at relatively little expense.  Let's think step by step."
